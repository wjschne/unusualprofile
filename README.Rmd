The goal of unusualprofile is to calculate conditional Mahalanobis distances and related statistics. Such statistics can help find cases that are unusual, even after controlling for specified predictors.

# Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wjschne/unusualprofile")
```

# Example

To use the unusualprofile package, one needs to know the correlations, means, and standard deviations among a set of continuous variables and at least one row of data from that set of variables.

Suppose we have set of variables that have the following relationships:

![Multivariate normal model](man/figures/rm_model.svg)

First, we load the unusualprofile package.

```{r}
library(unusualprofile)
```

Included with the unusualprofile package, the `d_example` data set has a single row of data generated from the path diagram depicted above.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d_example
```

Also included with the unusualprofile package is the path diagram's model-implied correlation matrix:

```{r}
R_example
```

## Using the `cond_maha` function

We can specify the correlations (`R`), means (`mu`), standard deviations (`sigma`). independent variables (`v_ind`), and dependent variables (`v_dep`). In this case, the independent variables are composite scores summarizing the dependent variables.

```{r example, dev='ragg_png', dpi=300}
# Conditional Mahalanobis distance
cm <- cond_maha(data = d_example, 
          R = R_example,
          mu = 0,
          sigma = 1,
          v_ind_composites = c("X", "Y"),
          v_dep = c("X_1", "X_2", "X_3",
                    "Y_1", "Y_2", "Y_3"))
